# This configuration file overrides the settings in 
# `./docker-compose.yml` when `DEBUG` is set
# to `true`.
#
# For example: The settings here allow for hot module
# reloading of the API server when code is changed.
#
# These settings are not applied when `DEBUG` mode is 
# set to `false`. Settings that are not listed here but
# are in the  main `./docker-compose.yml` will remain
# even if the ovveride is applied.
